### Lovely day, isn't it ðŸŒ™ðŸ¦‰ðŸ’» 

Hi! It's nice to see you here. A bit of a background about myself -- I used to work with Excel sheets and built some algorithms to process data, but I figured that I wanted to deploy and build applications so I learned how to code. I realized that the best way to grow in Software Engineering is to "let yourself be thrown into the fire" by building real-world projects, whether they may be personal or for work.

These are the tech stacks I have accumulated and used over the years, mostly based on the requirements for each project I handled.

So far, these are my most remarkable projects (I also have other needle-moving projects though)

Key builds and integrations:
1. Crystal wrapper for Thunderstore downloader
2. Crystal wrapper to download, unzip, and "walk" within nested folders
3. Meilisearch Crystal SDK
4. Ruby wrapper for Valhalla API

Other key contributions:
1. Mini bug fix for Stripe crystal wrapper

Unmerged projects:
1. Xero integration on ERPNext

Would be glad to discuss other projects and workflows or share my CV outside Github :rocket:
