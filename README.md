### Lovely day, isn't it 🌙🦉💻 

Hi! It's nice to see you here.
Allow me to introduce myself: I'm a full-time techie with a Life Sciences streak, creative-wannabe, sports enthusiast, musicophile, and a bookworm.

These are the tech stacks I have accumulated and used over the years, mostly based on the requirements for each project I handled.

So far, these are my most remarkable projects (I also have other needle-moving projects but these ones are my favorite):

Key builds and integrations:
1. Crystal wrapper for Thunderstore downloader (to install mods on Valheim servers with just one click)
2. Crystal wrapper to download, unzip, and "walk" within nested folders
3. Meilisearch Crystal SDK
4. Ruby wrapper for Valhalla API (routing)

Projects:
1. Game Server Hosting (Crystal on Lucky, Linux)
2. Product Management work for a full Accounting Platform 
3. Shipping Aggregator platform (Ruby on Rails)
4. Delivery services platform (Ruby on Rails)

Other key contributions:
1. Mini bug fix for Stripe Crystal wrapper (Open-source)

Unmerged projects (Did it for the plot):
1. Xero integration on ERPNext (Python on Frappe framework, Open-source bookkeeping and accounting platform)

Would be glad to discuss other projects and workflows or share my CV outside Github :rocket:
